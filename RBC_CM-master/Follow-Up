Presentation

1. The Problem / Background
- Ratings are not accurate. caused '08 crash
- Incorporate other features so we don't want to meet 100% exactly 
- discrepancy with tesla shareholders and actual stock price
- users: traders but also individual clients 
2. The Solution
- emphasis on how this information can be digested and used
3. Future Work
- All data was energy sector
- feature engineering through discussions with traders. sklearn decomp, ensemble, svm, bagged decision trees and random forest
- more data as always - 500 rows not enough
- consider Kensho data
- normalize using sector and firm that rated

Product:
- show how much invested
- show how much sold
- sort by num shares
